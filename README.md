## Introduction
Many low-level languages have a concept of macros that allow users to not have to write the same code over and over again. 
In Python, however, there isn't such a feature.

Why would anyone want macros in Python? 
- Python is a very dynamic language and can be slow at times because of the overhead of calling the same function over and over
- You might want to add inline parsing of a language like `sql` to remove runtime overhead of parsing a literal
- Other times you want to call a function before the script is run
- Because why not?
